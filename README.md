# Project: Moblie Calculator
# Version: 1.00

# Description:
This is a basic calculator application that I made to practice app development and using the Kivy library!
I also practiced using Google Colab, an Online Jupyter Notebook that provides free access to computing resources!
Google Colab ensures that the conversion process would be smooth, due to the amount of space it would take to install the used libraries.

I developed this application using Kivy documentation and an awesome tutorial from Tech2 etc!
